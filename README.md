****House Price Prediction using Machine Learning****
A complete end-to-end machine learning regression project for predicting house prices based on property features.
This project covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, training multiple ML models, and evaluating their performance.

Project Overview
Accurately predicting house prices is a common and practical machine learning problem.
This project demonstrates how to:
1. Clean and preprocess real-world data
2. Explore and visualize relationships between features
3. Encode categorical variables
4. Train multiple regression models
5. Compare their performance using MAPE
6. Generate output plots for understanding the dataset
7. The workflow is clean, modular, and easy to extend.
